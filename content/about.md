Hi, I'm Victor.

I'm currently working as Software Engineer (AI) at [DentalMonitoring](https://dental-monitoring.com/),
a french medtech unicorn.

I love learning new things so don't hesitate sharing with me new technologies!

My latest interest are:
* Machine Learning (PyTorch, Jax, Deep Learning Production)
* Frontend Development (Svelte + TS + Tailwindcss)
* Backend Development (Rust)

You will find some of my projects and some blogs in this website!
